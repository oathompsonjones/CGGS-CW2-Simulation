This report makes references to videos, which can be found in the
    \texttt{videos} directory of the submission.
The videos are numbered in the order they are referenced in the report.

The code for sections 1 and 2 can be found in the \texttt{section-12} directory
    of the submission, containing the \texttt{scene.h} and \texttt{mesh.h} files.
The code for section 3 can be found in the \texttt{section-3} directory,
    containing the same mesh.h and constraints.h files, with an updated version of
    the scene.h file.
